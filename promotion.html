Group task: Make one page campaign website and film a video about biking rules in Copenhagen.
</p>
<p>
My part: Really wanted to make a video funny, since we could not use footage from internet, I was nagging teammates to make a bicycle accident, but they did not agree. I actually would have been surprised if they did. Looks like I was the pure evil of the group. Without it, I took a part in creating story board, provided a helmet, filmed some of the shots and wrote some of the script for the video. Happily I am not included in the video, since I do not feel comfortable against camera.
