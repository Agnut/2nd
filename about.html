      My name is Agne Baranauskaite, born in Lithuania and currently 21 years old. I am currently studying multimedia design and communication course at KEA, Copenhagen. I already know how to code html, css and some javaScript but I hope to get more knowledge in future. Of course, I like designing the most, but coding is also catchy activity for me. In my free time I am doing make-ups and taking photos. These two used to take a lot of my time, but since I moved to Denmark and especially started studying, did not have so much time for makeup and photography anymore, but from time to time I am still very willing to take a brushes or camera into my hands.
