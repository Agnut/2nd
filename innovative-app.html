<p>
Group task: Develop an innovative digital concept that could be a service app, product or something similar with an extraordinary user experience as well as a prototype website introducing and promoting your 
digital service or product.
</p>
<p>
My part: Would be unfair to say that I did something on my own, we were especially teamworking group and every final decision we made together. All of us generated ideas, created business model canvas, wrote a report, created design documentation and prepared pitch. Small part of the assignment was done individually by other group members such as web prototype and app design, but even on those final decisions were made by all group members.
